Hi! My name is Yu Chen He, and I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I am writing to you to express my
most profound interest in the position of Full Stack Developer Intern in Operate Solutions team. Both my knowledge in the software development industry 
and experience in this field algins perfectly with this position and I know I would be a very valuable asset to have your your team. After working with 
some industry leaders in Canada and in China, I have accumulated skills essential for a full stack and software developer, including dealing with project deadlines and 
how to meet them, working with multiple teams for production release, and ensuring a smooth workflow within my team. Not only that, I possess several skills 
indispensible for developing full stack software solutions, such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Engineering frontend user interface with various React libraries
  \item Maintaining backend server performance in Node.js and in Python Flask
  \item Managing stable production database using MySQL and relevant tools such as Navicat
  \item Deploying services to online platform including GCP and AWS
  \item Improving code readability with proper documentation and version control with Git
  \item Working closely with product managers to convert business needs into software features
  \item Communicating using professional vocabulary in English, French, and Mandarin
\end{itemize}

These software development skills, combined with my interpersonal communication skillset that I've acquired through working closely with large teams and 
learning full stack development along other students at Lighthouse Labs bootcamp, which includes problem solving in a group, managing conflicts,
effective team management and dealing with emergencies. 

Even though I do not have much experience working with projects that involves Unity, I am a very passionate gamer and I have played with many games made with Unity engine,
such as Assassin's Creed, Rust and mostly Hearthstone. Hope that makes up my lack of interaction with Unity.

Please review my attached application for further details regarding my experiences. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about my qualifications.

Thank you for your consideration.
